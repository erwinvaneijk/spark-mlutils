General Info
============

Spark-mlutils is a collection of (hopefully) useful methods and classes I've
used a one point or another in my spark projects.

NLP
===

The tests use the `en-token.bin` trained model from opennlp-1.5, and I've yet
to find a way to get it at test-time, so I've included it in the source for now.
